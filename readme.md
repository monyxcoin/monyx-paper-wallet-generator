# Monyx Paper Wallet Generator

After you generated a new address, you can import it into Monyx wallets by doing this:

1. Open Monyx wallet
2. Open "Help" menu item
3. Click on "Debug window"
3. Select the "Console" tab
4. Type `importprivkey {your private key from the paper wallet}`

Then you'll have the private key added to the wallet, so you can see all transaction, withdraw, etc.
